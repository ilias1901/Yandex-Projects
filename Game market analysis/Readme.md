# Game market analysis

## Used methods:
- Visualisation
- A/B testing


## Libraries Used
pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy

## Task
We need to :
1) Analyse the game market till the year 2016;

2) Check the differences between regions, platforms and genres;

3) Make an A/B test for mean users score between some platfoms and genres.

## Conclusion

**According to our research based on total sales sum, we could assume the following:**


1) Top sales platforms are: PS3, PS4, Wii, WiiU, X360, XOne;

2) Sales are reducing at all the platforms from 2013 to 2016;

3) We see high growth of new games at platforms XOne, PS3 and PS4. We could call these platforms perspective; 

All the above mentioned consoles have already reached their sales peak and slowly reducing their sales. So even perspective platforms have only 4-5 years.

**Market analysis**

At first we should mention that Japan market differ from Europe and USA market. Most probably it is caused by cultural differences.
1) USA and Europe:
 - `Shooter` and `Sports` genres are most popular;

 - Popular platform - `PS4`. Rating - `M`

2) Japan:
 - `RPG` and `Fighting` are most popular;
 
 - `Nintendo DS` is popular platform. Rating in not significant, because 60% of Japan market games doesn't have it.

**A/B test**

Test shows that most probably:
1) The platform type doesn't affect the user score;

2) We won't receive equal mean user score in different genres.
