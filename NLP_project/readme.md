# Toxic Comment Classification Project
## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that classifies user comments as either positive or negative based on their toxicity. We aim to achieve a minimum F1 score of 0.75 as the quality metric for our model.

## Project Steps
1. Data Preparation
Load and prepare the dataset provided (toxic_comments.csv).
Ensure the dataset is correctly formatted and contains the necessary columns: text (comment text) and toxic (toxicity label).
2. Model Training
Experiment with different machine learning models for comment classification.
Utilize various natural language processing techniques.
Evaluate the models using relevant evaluation metrics to assess their performance.
3. Conclusion
Summarize the findings and observations from the model training process.
Discuss the performance of different models and techniques.
Reflect on the achievement of the project's goal: an F1 score of at least 0.75.
Data Description
The dataset for this project, toxic_comments.csv, consists of two main columns:

`text`: This column contains the text of user comments.
`toxic`: This column serves as the target attribute, indicating whether a comment is toxic (1) or not toxic (0).
